## The Opportunity

| **Digital Penetration** | <5% (massive whitespace) | McKinsey Auto Retail 2024 |

## The Problem

Vehicle owners face a **broken experience** when seeking automotive services:

- Complete vehicle management (maintenance, recalls, documents)
- AI-powered car shopping tools

**For Service Providers:**
- Access to qualified leads
- No monthly fees - pay only for opportunities
- Built-in payment processing
- Analytics and reputation building

## Business Model

| Revenue Stream | Mechanism |
|----------------|-----------|
| **Service Credits** | Providers purchase bid packs ($10-$10,000) |
| **Transaction Fees** | 2% on escrow-processed jobs |
| **Merchandise** | Branded automotive products |

## The Ask

**Raising:** $500,000 Seed Round

**Use of Funds:**
- 40% Engineering (mobile apps, API scaling)
- 30% Marketing (provider acquisition)
- 20% Operations (customer success)
- 10% Legal/Compliance

**Milestones:** 500 providers, 5,000 members, $250K ARR within 12 months

# THE PROBLEM

## A $443B Industry Running on Phone Calls

The automotive aftermarket is one of the largest consumer markets in America—yet it operates like it's 1995.

### The Vehicle Owner's Pain

```
📞 Call Shop A → "We'll call you back with a quote"
📞 Call Shop B → "Bring it in, we'll take a look"  
📞 Call Shop C → Voicemail
📞 Call Shop D → "$800... or maybe $1,200"
😤 Give up → Overpay at the first shop that answers
```

**76% of consumers don't trust auto mechanics** (AAA survey)

### Why This Pain Persists

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Information asymmetry** | Shops know more than customers |
| **No price discovery** | Calling for quotes is exhausting |
| **Quality uncertainty** | Hard to verify skills before hiring |
| **Payment risk** | No protection if work is subpar |

### The Provider's Frustration

Independent mechanics and shops struggle too:

- **Customer acquisition cost** is high (advertising, referrals)
- **No-shows** waste valuable bay time
- **Payment delays** hurt cash flow
- **Reputation building** is slow and fragmented

## Market Timing: Why Now?

### The Perfect Storm

**1. Aging Vehicle Fleet**
- Average vehicle age: **12.8 years** (record high)
- Up 2 months year-over-year for 2nd consecutive year
- **119M vehicles** in "sweet spot" (4-11 years old)

**2. Extended Ownership**
- High new car prices keeping owners longer
- 27% of trade-ins are "underwater" (negative equity)
- New vehicle sales down from 17.3M (2015-19) to 15.2M forecast

**3. Rising Vehicle Miles**
- VMT up **1.0% YoY** through 2025
- More driving = more wear = more repairs

**4. Digital Transformation Gap**
- <5% of aftermarket is digitized
- Consumers expect Uber/DoorDash-level convenience
- First mover captures network effects

# COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

## Current Market State

| Category | Players | Limitation |
|----------|---------|------------|
| **Dealer Networks** | Dealerships | Expensive, limited to brand |
| **Franchise Chains** | Jiffy Lube, Midas | Limited services, no bidding |
| **Lead Gen** | Yelp, Thumbtack | No payment protection |
| **Vertical Apps** | RepairPal, Openbay | Service-only, no vehicle management |

## Our Competitive Advantages

### 1. Two-Sided Network Effects

More providers → Better pricing → More members → More providers

**This is defensible.** Once critical mass is achieved, switching costs are high for both sides.

### 2. Escrow Payment Protection

Unlike Yelp/Thumbtack, we hold funds until job completion:
- Members trust unknown providers
- Providers get guaranteed payment
- Platform earns fee for facilitating trust

### 3. Complete Vehicle Ecosystem

Competitors focus on ONE thing. We own the relationship:

| Competitor | Services | Vehicles | Documents | Shopping | Recalls |
|------------|----------|----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| RepairPal | ✓ | - | - | - | - |
| Openbay | ✓ | - | - | - | - |
| CarFax | - | - | - | ✓ | ✓ |
| **MCC** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

### 4. Viral Referral Economics

**50% lifetime commission** creates army of recruiters:
- Every user is incentivized to bring providers
- Drastically reduces CAC
- Self-reinforcing growth loop

### 5. Multi-Platform Presence

- PWA (works in any browser)
- iOS native app
- Android native app
- Desktop apps (Windows, Mac, Linux)
